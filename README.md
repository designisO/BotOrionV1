# Discord Bot : BotOrionV1

<img src="Discord Bot 1.png"/>


In this repo I was able to create a discord bot that greets new users to the server DEVS ON BLOCKS. The bot also provides inspiring quotes when users type "dobq" in the server thread.

Discord is a voice and text communication platform for gamers, streamers and developers. As the platform grew in popularity, the reaction to user request are vital to the community build. With a bot it is possible to automatically react to the new member joining the guild (server). 


## Installing Discord

pip install discord


## Building Bot

.env file contains the token id and guild id. 


## Usage

Simply run the bot.py with correct token and guild id credentials.
